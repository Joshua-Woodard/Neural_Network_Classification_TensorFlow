# Neural Network Classification TensorFlow
Jupyter Notebook created alongside course study for Neural Network Classification using TensorFlow

## What it covers:
* Binary Classification (2 classes)
* Multiclass Classification (>2 classes)
* Multilabel Classification (like tags on a picture, one image can have multiple labels)
* `Relu` and `Sigmoid` activations
* Plotting loss curves
* Finding best learning rate for optimizer
* Create Confusion Matrix to visualize results
